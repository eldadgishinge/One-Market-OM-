We created a platform called One market to tackle the issue faced by most tourists in Rwanda of overpriced products to buy. This phase of our project contains a list of items tourists may want to buy in Rwanda and the price range at which they should purchase the commodities in Rwanda. This platform will promote trade between tourists and local sellers and assure the tourists that they buy the products at a fair price without the fear of being overcharged.
